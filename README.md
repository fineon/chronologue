# Chronologue
----------------
by [The Good Docs Project](thegooddocsproject.dev)

The Chronologue project is a completely fictional open source project used to illustrate what good documentation looks like in practice.

Chronologue helps you see what the The Good Docs Project [templates](https://www.github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates) look like in action, with actual content.

### Why a fictional project?

We could link to real projects that have great documentation (whether or not they use our templates) but we would have to keep checking to make sure our recommendations and those projects' docs were still in sync.

By using a fictional project we can also give examples of what _not_ to do without hurting anyone's feelings.


### Repository structure

On our `main` branch, we store the code for the Chronologue website and its API. 
On our [`docs`](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/chronologue/tree/docs) branch, we store the code for the Chronologue documentation. 

#### The `main` branch
The website is built with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/). We use Netlify functions to make our API come to life.

We protected this branch to ensure we work together smoothly.
Branch protection rules: 
- You can't delete this branch
- You can't force push on this branch

As we get more developers for the Chronologue website, we might add additional branch protection rules. 

#### The `docs` branch

We are in the process of building the initial version of the Chronologue documentation. 
Until we have released the first version,  we keep a summary of our knowledge in the [Chronologue Wiki](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/chronologue/wiki). 

We protected this branch to ensure we work together smoothly.
Branch protection rules: 
- You can't delete this branch.
- You can't force push on this branch.
- You can't commit directly onto the branch. You have to open a PR. 
- You need at least 1 approval to merge the branch.
