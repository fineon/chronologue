# Chronologue
----------------
by [The Good Docs Project](thegooddocsproject.dev)

The Chronologue project is a completely fictional open source project used to illustrate what good documentation looks like in practice.

Chronologue helps you see what the The Good Docs Project [templates](https://www.github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates) look like in action, with actual content.

This repository contains files for the Chronologue API. We keep a summary of our knowledge in the [Chronologue Wiki](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/chronologue/wiki). 
The documentation for Chronologue will be hsoted on [the Good Docs project website](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/website-hugo). 

### Why a fictional project?

We could link to real projects that have great documentation (whether or not they use our templates) but we would have to keep checking to make sure our recommendations and those projects' docs were still in sync.

By using a fictional project we can also give examples of what _not_ to do without hurting anyone's feelings.

### How Can I Use Chronologue?

Chronologue is primarily an educational resource. You are free to link to, reproduce, or repurpose this text, within the bounds of our [license](/LICENSE).

We hope you find Chronologue useful as a way to explore technical writing and open source project documentation using templates.
